\chapter{Further Development}
\label{further_development}
This chapter elaborates on the features purposed for further development of the product.  

\section{Proposal for Future Features}
\label{proposal_for_future_features}
After the group conducted focus groups with providers and system maintainers, and with families, the group had a lot of feedback on what worked well as well as improvements. Both providers and families had discussions about how the group could improve the product, and what kind of features could be implemented in the future. Proposals for these features will be introduced in this section, and is grouped by milestones on GitHub (see table \ref{MilestonesForFurterDevelopment}). Some of the proposals are requests from the customer.

\subsection{User Facilitation}
\label{UserFacilitation}
User facilitation is an important part of the product, thus the highest priority for further development. Based on feedback from the focus group with families, both parents and children came to the conclusion that facilitation can, and should be, represented by symbols. They also suggested the idea about automatic filtering of activities and providers by customized user profile facilitation.

Milestone 6 expands further on facilitation, and adds features to the web portal that has the highest priority for further development. When someone with a newly created profile wants to see upcoming activities and search for activities, only the ones that fit the user profile's facilitation are displayed. This feature is something the user should be able to turn off or bypass, so that they can see all activities as well. To implement this, a way to add facilitation to user profiles is needed. Default search on activity- and provider page should be with the user profile facilitation, but this filter can be turned off.

\subsection{Activities}
\subsubsection{Information}
\label{UserFeedbackAboutActivities}
The feedback on how the activities were presented on the web portal gave basis for new ideas and improvements. A shared view amongst the test subject are the importance of showing user facilitation as early and clearly as possible. The users who tested the web portal, wanted this information displayed already on the activity card.

Test subjects also discussed whether to use symbols or text to display the activity facilitations. The test group came up with a conclusion that further development should test displaying user facilitation with only symbols on activity card and -modal. A textual description of the symbols should also be represented on the front page along with the symbols.

Information regarding the number of assistants was seen on as superfluous (see section \ref{removals}). The general wish was to instead add information about whether or not a personal supervisor was needed when attending an activity.

\subsubsection{Creating and Sharing}
The test group also wanted the opportunity to see other users attending an event. This can be accomplished by showing if friends from Facebook are attending. Another request was the opportunity to share an event from the web portal to Facebook and other social media.

For further development there were also some requests regarding events. Creating an event based on already existing events was very popular. This would allow for minimal work if users or providers have previously created many similar events. The opportunity for creating an event based on a Facebook event was much appreciated. Further improving this functionality, and adding additional support for using other social media as well, would improve the overall user experience.

\subsection{Providers}
\subsubsection{Information}
During the focus group with the providers and system maintainers, the system maintainers for Aktørbase said that providers need to register city-location in Aktørbase. Therefore they wanted a feature on SkalVi.no where users can search for providers by city-location. This is also a feature that the families requested on the focus group with families, so they easily could find activities close to where they live. Additionally, the families wanted more contact information about the providers on each activity. The providers also wanted a way to see which users are following them. For future development, a new filter should be implemented to search on city location and features to retrieve and display which users are following a provider.

\subsubsection{Verification}
At the end of the project, the customer requested that he wanted the product to display that a provider is actually using SkalVi.no, and if an activity is actually created by a verified provider. The verification will therefore allow users to see if a provider has created an activity or if another user created it. Thus filter for verified providers should be implemented. For a user to see this, there has to be an icon that displays this on each activity that is created by a verified provider. The same icon should also be on each page for verified providers. Each provider needs to fill in what kind of facilitations they offer when registering as a provider on SkalVi.no. 


\subsection{Moderating Comments}
The parents who attended the focus group with families were concerned with the comments for each activity. They said that other people often tend to write negative and non-constructive comments if they were displeased with an activity they attended. Therefore, the parents requested a feature that does not allow users to write these kind of comments. 

To reduce the risk of negative and non-constructive comments, SkalVi.no does not allow anonymous users to post comments on activities. A user must be logged in to write comments, and their name is displayed along with the comment. For this to be improved in the future, there are two ways to do it. There must either be actual people moderating and removing negative comments, or methods must be implemented that automatically detects negative comments and does not allow the user to post it, which is near impossible.

\subsection{Plugins}
The customer has been very eager from the beginning of the project that SkalVi.no should be compatible with social media functionalities and different kinds of plugins. In addition to the existing solutions that SkalVi.no have, the customer wants providers to have the opportunity to add, for example a calendar where all their activities are registered. When a provider adds a calendar to SkalVi.no, the provider can then choose an activity from the calendar to base their new activities on.

\section{Privacy Policy}
A privacy policy is a statement or legal document that discloses how a website collects, uses and manages a customers or client's data. A web page that collects user data that can be used to identify individuals is required to provide a privacy policy.

For the web portal to go into production, writing a privacy policy and providing this on the web portal would be required. This would fulfill Facebook and Instagram's requirements for using their APIs to exit development mode. This will allow users outside the registered test users and developers to interact with the functionalities the API provide.

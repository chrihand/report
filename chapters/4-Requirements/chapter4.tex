\section{Minimum Viable Product}
\label{MVP}
The group represents their commitment and shared goal by specifying a definition of the minimum viable product that they are to deliver when the project deadline is due.

The Minimal Viable Product (denoted as MVP) the group is to deliver is a web portal with a homepage, an overall activity page, admin and user profile pages. The Web portals home page presents upcoming events to the user. The portal is a user account service - meaning the events the homepage presents depends on the user logged in, such as 'my events'  if the user are hosting some. The portal will have an page that displays all the registered events, and allows for search and filtering. 
The design of the portal, will be under the WCAG 2.0.

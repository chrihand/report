\section{Customer input}
During the first meeting with the customer, the group received input about the overall structure of the desired product, as well as the research required. The customer emphasized the fact that the project is a “Proof of Concept”, and that the group had to research utilizing universal design principles in web applications. The application to be developed is purposed to be used in Trondheim municipality, with the possibility to be scaled up to a bigger user group. Therefore both server development and graphical user interface is necessary for this project. Customer input had an impact on the group's choice of technology.

The application was meant to be used in Trondheim municipality by Trondheim Kommune to easily allow parents and youths to find, participate and master recreational activities. This user base represented a big group of users, and the project was therefore allocated resources to perform workshops and user tests. Such test would be prior for a successful application and project.

The goal of the project is to create a web portal for the users and with the users. Therefore the users are going to be participating during the whole development process.

\section{Alternative Solutions}
\label{alternativeSolutions}
The user group for this product, does not have many alternative solutions to choose from today. In Trondheim there are just a few solution available, but nationally there are several solutions located around the country. 

In Trondheim, TRDevents \cite{TRDevents} is the biggest portal to view activities and other arrangements. Both organisations and private people can register events. Their focus is to list all arrangements in Trondheim and it is meant to keep everyone updated about upcoming arrangements and activities. The cite is not adapted to the specific users of this product.

A portal that is more aimed towards the users of this product is KUBA \cite{KUBA}. KUBA stands for "Kultur for Barn" (Culture for children), and is Trondheim municipality's cultural program for children in all ages. KUBA strives to be as diverse and as inclusive as possible such that everyone can participate in their activities.

A more national offer is Beitostølen Helsesportsenter (denoted as BHSS) \cite{BHSS}. BHSS gives people in all ages with physical, psychological and/or cognitive disabilities the opportunity to rehabilitation through activities. The rehabilitation takes place at their center in Beitostølen located in Øystre Slindre municipality. Their main focus is on opportunities rather than limitations.  

\section{Tools}
\label{tools}
The following section will contain information about all tools used in this project, including both tools for communication, document sharing, project planning and organization and project development.

\subsection{Project Management and Communication}

\subsubsection{Slack}
The group has chosen Slack \cite{Slack} as the main communication channel within the group. Slack allows members to create distinct threads, where discussions about different subjects can be discussed. This makes communication easier and cleaner, compared to other chat-applications like Facebook Messenger. Slack also provide great integration with GitHub, which means Slack will keep group members updated on all changes at the group's GitHub repository. 

\subsubsection{Email}
The selected communication channel between the group - and the group supervisor and the customer was email.
Email was chosen because it is easy to maintain and sender and receiver have their own copies. Also the possibility to send attachments, categorise on subject and has unlimited amount of characters has been a motivation to use email.  

\subsubsection{Toggl}
Toggl \cite{Toggl} is chosen as the group's time tracking tool. It makes it easy to track time, and specify what each group member are working on. Toggl provides great visualization of time spent on different tasks, with different types of charts and diagrams. It is also open for the entire group, which means every group member can see what other members are working on. Toggl also uses tags so it is easy to divide group tasks. This allows for tracking progress and what type of tasks is most time consuming.

\subsubsection{Git}
Git \cite{Git} is a open source, version control system, which allows teams to work on projects that are small or big with speed and efficiency. Git is a tool to manage project source code history and replaces source code management (denoted as SCM)  tools, because of cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.

\subsubsection{GitHub}
\label{GitHub}
GitHub\cite{GitHub} is a hosting service for distributed revision- and version control systems. GitHub offers SCM functionality, access control and many more collaboration and project features. Such as wiki-pages, task management tools, and different types of repositories for your projects such as public and private. The groups decision to use Github was based on that fact, that the customer demanded that the project to be open source, and hosted on Github. 

\subsubsection{Waffle.io}
\label{Waffle.io}
The group has chosen Waffle.io \cite{Waffle} as the main task manager tool. The entire product backlog and all sprint backlogs, are managed with Waffle.io. Waffle.io has great integration with GitHub, and will automatically syncronize tasks with issues on GitHub. The opportunity to create burndown-charts in relation to the work accomplished in Waffle.io or at GitHub is also possible. This is the main reason for why the group chose to work with Waffle.io compared to other known tools like Trello.

\subsubsection{Google Drive}
For document sharing, the group chose to use Google Drive \cite{GoogleDrive}. Google Drive has a great way to share documents and information between a group. It also allows the group members to write in the same document, and edit the same files in real time. That makes it easy for all members to collaborate. Google Drive was mainly chosen because of the easy collaboration opportunities, which other competitors like Dropbox or OneDrive does not support. 

\subsubsection{ShareLaTeX and LaTeX}
ShareLatex \cite{ShareLatex} is an online editor for writing documents, which allows collaborative work in real time. Latex is a typesetting system, created for writing scientific and technical documents.

The group selected Latex and ShareLatex due to the fact that it is easy to construct and maintain the document, even when the document becomes large. Here Latex are a better choice than for example Google Docs. The group also chose Latex, because of the possibility to store back-ups in GitHub.

\subsubsection{PyCharmIDE}
PyCharm is a professional Integrated Development Environment for professional Python developers. The group has chosen to use PyCharm, because it will help produce code more effectivly. 

\subsection{Front End}
\subsubsection{React}
For front-end development the group chose to use components defined in React \cite{React} combined with static HTML-files. The React library offers easy creation of components that are dynamic, fast rendering, and is user friendly. This resulted in being able to create web pages that are responsive and load fast. Using React, the overall structure of the project also became organized, easy to understand and update.

\subsubsection{Bootstrap}
Another tool used for front-end development is Bootstrap \cite{Bootstrap}. This is one of the most used HTML, CSS and Javascript framework to develop responsive and mobile websites. The group chose to use Bootstrap because it will help writing cleaner code and it will save the group heaps of time writing CSS-code. 


\subsection{Back End}
\subsubsection{Amazon Web Services - EC2}
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud services platform, offering compute power, database storage,and much more. \cite{AWS} The group proposed to host the web portal on a Virtual private server (denoted as VPS)  instead of web hotel to the customer. Based on the benefits and discussions, the customer decided to use VPS as hosting service, and to go with Amazon Web Services as provider, because they are the big in the game and also because they can "survive" anything, which is an important requirement for the customer. That the web portal and it's data, doesn't disappear over night. 

The group choose to use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (denoted as EC2) \cite{EC2} It is a web service that gives complete control of the computing resources and reduces time used to create a VPS instance. The decision was also given by the fact that part of the team have prior experience with EC2 technology. 


\subsubsection{Nginx}
The group chose to use Nginx \cite{nginx} as a reverse proxy and load balance between the EC2 instance and the web portal application. The use of reverse proxy can hide the existence of an origin server, and to reduce the stress-load on the web portal. The group decided to use Nginx instead of e.g Apache2, because the groups chief of back-end had prior experience with Nginx.


\subsubsection{Python}
The programming language for the server side of the web portal, the group choose to use Python because, "Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively" \cite{python}. The group has previous experience with the language and it's a language that almost every developer knows. So when the project is done, and someone else is to further develop the project, they can easily get started and doesn't have to learn a new language.

\subsubsection{Django}
Django \cite{django} has be chosen as the main framework for writing the entire back end of the web portal. Django is a high-level framework for developing websites with a back end consisting of Python. All group members have experience with Python, and combined with the Django framework, this will allow for rapid development.  

\subsubsection{SQLite}
SQLite\cite{SQLite} was chosen as the type of database. SQLite uses normal SQL quires, which the entire group already had knowledge about. SQLite is a light weight version of MySQL, which would be more than enough to satisfy the customer's demands. Django also has great support for SQLite, which makes it easier for the group to use SQLite during development.

\subsection{Testing}
\subsubsection{Test frameworks}
The group has chosen to use Python own test framework and Selenium WebDriver \cite{selenium}. Django uses unittest module that is built in to the Python standard library, for testing. Automated testing is an extremely useful bug-killing tool for web developing. That is why the group chose to use Django’s test client \cite{DjanoTestClient} to establish that the correct template is being rendered and that the template is passed the correct context data. Selenium, which is a in-browser framework, is used to test rendered HTML and the behavior of Web pages, namely JavaScript functionality.

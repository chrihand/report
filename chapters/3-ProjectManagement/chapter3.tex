\chapter{Project Management}

\section{Methodology}
\label{methodology}
During the development of the product the group decided to utilize scrum and the agile methodology. This was a natural choice of methodology as the customer required the process to be iterative, based on the group's previous experiences and the research completed (see section \ref{s:development_process}). 

The process methodology was adjusted to suit the project in the best possible manner, as well as to suit the group's needs. The group completed daily meetings, sprint reviews and sprint retrospectives to achieve the best possible outcome of the project. The product owner was also the project's customer, and will be referred to as the customer throughout this report. To maintain consistent communication with the customer, there were scheduled stand-up meetings weekly with the opportunity for more if needed. 

During the development process the group also utilized some principles from Extreme Programming, specifically the practice of pair programming. A decision based upon the groups desire to maximize the learning opportunities from each other, resulting in the best possible outcome. As the productivity was increased by efficiently sharing knowledge and discussing problems, the quality of the code was subsequently improved.  

\subsection{Development}
Throughout the development the group utilized the practice of issue tracking on GitHub (see section \ref{GitHub}), and structured the tasks based on a roadmap using milestones. 
To ensure that the group followed the principles of Scrum, it was decided to define the milestones as a correspondence to time and by determining which milestones should be included in which sprint. 

To easily track the issues during the development the group used Waffle.io (see section \ref{Waffle.io}) as a Scrum board. This provided the group a visualization of the process in real time, with issues in 'product backlog', 'sprint backlog' and 'in process' including whom was working on which, using assignees. 

\subsection{Report}
Waffle.io (see section \ref{Waffle.io}) was also used during the process of writing the report, primarily to ensure that every member participated in writing the report, and that everyone needed to proof-read each part before it were categorized as done.

\section{Team Organization}\label{projectOrganisation}
The group decided to divide the project into reasonable areas of development, and delegated the main responsibility to two or more of the group members, where one had the main responsibility. This would ensure that all parts of the project were kept in mind during the development, as well as more than one person knew what was going on in one specific area.

\subsubsection{Scrum Master}
Responsible: Ingrid Skar \\
Skar was given the role as Scrum Master due to previous experience with leading a team and the coordination of Scrum related tasks. This includes coordinating work packages, sprints and milestones.

\subsubsection{Group Leader}
Responsible: Christina Hellenes Andresen \\
Andresen became group leader though a vote within the group. The role as group leader includes having an overview of the project status, attending group leader meetings, create meeting agendas and lead the group meetings.  

\subsubsection{Contact Responsible}
Responsible: Sigve André Evensen Skaugvoll \\
Skaugvoll was selected as the responsible person for keeping contact with both customer and supervisor. The contact responsible acted as a link between the group and both the customer and supervisor, arranging meetings and making sure both parts got the meeting agenda before the meetings.

\subsubsection{Architect}
Responsible: Martin Stigen \\
The role of architect was given to Stigen, due to interests and experience. The architect was responsible for providing an initial draft of the architecture and for integrating the back end together with the front end. Skaugvoll was also a part of the architect team.

\subsubsection{Database}
Responsible: Andreas Norstein\\
Norstein was assigned the main responsibility for the database given his previous experiences from courses at QUT. The responsibility included investigating the different options and requirements for the database. Norstein had this responsibility together with Skaugvoll.

\subsubsection{Back End}
Responsible: Sigve André Evensen Skaugvoll\\
The main responsibility for this role was investigating the back end options and setting up the project server. Skaugvoll worked together with Norstein after the group had decided on using Django as the back end. Skaugvoll and Norstein were elected based on some prior experience through own projects, course at NTNU and interests.

\subsubsection{Front End}
Responsible: Thomas Wold\\
Wold was given the role as front end responsible, mainly because of experiences with front end development from courses he had attended at NTNU. This responsibility was shared with Skar and Stigen. Their work included choosing development languages, frameworks and libraries, as well as preparing the development environment.

\subsubsection{Graphical User Interface Designer}
Responsible: Ingrid Skar\\
The graphical user interface designer was responsible for creating the paper prototype and styling the product. Skar was given the main responsibility for this task, together with Andresen, mainly because of interests in this field.

\subsubsection{Testing}
Responsible: Christina Hellenes Andresen\\
Andresen was given the role as tester, this included setting up test a plan- and strategies. Skaugvoll and Skar were co-responsible for testing. 

\subsubsection{Report}
Responsible: Christina Hellenes Andresen\\
Andresen was given the role of report responsible, due to previous experience. This role included setting up the table of content and keeping the report backlog updated on Waffle.io \ref{Waffle.io}. Wold was also a part of this team.

\section{Work Breakdown Structure}
The group decided to break down the main project activities into manageable sections, defined as work packages (see figure \ref{Work_Breakdown_Structure}). By outlining the project and organizing it into smaller sections, the group achieved a greater understanding of the scope of what was expected to be developed.

\begin{figure}[ht]

    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{fig/work_packages_new}
\caption{Work Breakdown Structure}
\label{Work_Breakdown_Structure}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Gantt Diagram} \label{GanttDiagram}
The project's life cycle was visualized using a Gantt Diagram (see figure \ref{Gantt_Diagram}). This was useful while planning the development process, as the group achieved a common understanding of what should be done in which phase, and could determine resources based on this. 

The model reflects how using agile methodologies (see section \ref{methodology}) affected the project. The development was divided into sprints lasting 2 weeks. The life cycle of the other work packages depended on the scope; some lasted throughout the entire project, such as the project management, and others occurred in specific phases, such as planning or testing.

\section{Risk Analysis} 
\label{riskAnalysis}
The initial risk analysis (see table \ref{risk_analysis}) was created during sprint iteration 0. The cases and their values were mainly based on experience from previous projects. During the development of the project they were adapted by thoroughly going through each case collaboratively, doing new evaluations. Updates made to the risk analysis can be found in section \ref{updated_risk_analysis}. 

Each risk was evaluated and given a number between 1 and 9. One is considered minimal likelihood to occur, and 9 is very likely to occur. The risks were then arranged according to importance and sorted in descending order. The preventive actions are the actions the group carried out to prevent the risks of happening. If a risk occurred, the group considered the remedial action to solve the case at hand.

\section{Milestones}
\label{milestones}
The milestones (see table \ref{Milestones}) consist of the important dates given in the project. It does also contain the different phases of the project, in accordance to GitHub's guidelines \cite{GitHubGuide}. The product related milestones includes issues (see section \ref{product_backlog}), which were mainly based on the user stories (see section \ref{User stories}). These were created as the project evolved together with the customer.

\section{Sprints}
\label{s:sprints}
The group divided the development process into sprints (see table \ref{t:sprints}), were each sprint lasted for two weeks, running Monday to the Friday the next week. Each sprint was planned with respect to the given milestone (see section \ref{milestones}). During a sprint the group arranged daily stand-up meetings (see section \ref{daily-meetings}) and workdays (see section \ref{workdays}), to plan and work on the project. 

In order to follow the chosen methodology the group arranged meetings with the costumer each Wednesday from Sprint 1 to Sprint 5, and completed Sprint Reviews. The meetings were informal and facilitated a close cooperation with the customer. The customer meetings are further discussed in section \ref{ss:customer_meetings}.

At the end of each sprint the group completed a Sprint retrospective; were each member reflected over the past sprint, and suggested actions to improve to the upcoming sprint. This allowed each member to individually express how they thought the development was progressing, as well as how to further develop as a group.

\subsection{Workdays}
\label{workdays}
The group had four workdays a week (see table \ref{Time table}). The working hours were decided during the planning phase. During these hours it was expected that the group sat together and worked on the project. The hours were set at times were no one had lectures or other activities to attend. Sitting together gave an overview of what the rest of the group were working on, and made it convenient to help each other. During the workdays the group members worked on individual tasks or in pairs. 

\subsection{Daily Meetings}
\label{daily-meetings}
The daily meetings lasted for 15 minutes or longer if needed. These meetings were used to update each other on progress, current problems and making group decisions. Mondays were used to plan the upcoming sprints, or review the progress of the current. All the daily meeting were documented (see example in appendix \ref{meeting_minutes_daily_meetings}).

\caption{Weekly Time Table}
\label{Time table}
\end{longtable}


\subsection{Customer Meetings} \label{ss:customer_meetings}
Initially the customer and the group decided to meet on a bi-weekly basis, but realized that this was to infrequent as the project developed. This was resolved by arranging weekly meetings. During these meetings the group updated the customer on the project status, demonstrated the latest prototype and got feedback on what tasks to prioritize next. This ensured that the development of the product corresponded to the customer's vision. All meetings with the customer were documented (see example in appendix \ref{meeting_minutes_customer_meetings}).
 
\subsection{Supervisor Meetings}
The group met with the supervisor bi-weekly. During these meetings the supervisor was updated on the work completed and the plan for the upcoming weeks. The supervisor also supported the group by answering questions regarding the report, work process and other relevant questions. All meetings were documented and the meeting minutes were sent to the supervisor after the meeting (see example in appendix \ref{meeting_minutes_supervisor_meetings}).

\subsection{Product Backlog}
\label{product_backlog}
The product backlog was requested by the customer to be updated as the product evolved. This was to be done on GitHub (see section \ref{GitHub}), so that the customer had all necessary information in one place (see figure \ref{Open Issues} and figure \ref{Closed Issues}). The group used Waffle.io (see section \ref{Waffle.io}) to manage the product backlog, using labels to indicate the related user story (see section \ref{User stories}) and the development status.

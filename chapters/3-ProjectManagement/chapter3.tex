\chapter{Project Management}

\section{Methodology}
\label{methodology}
During the development of the product the group decided to utilise scrum and the agile methodology. This was a natural choice of methodology as the customer required the process to be iterative and based on the group's previous experiences.

The process methodology was adjusted to suit the project in the best possible manner, as well as to suit the group's needs. The group completed sprint reviews, sprint retrospectives and daily meetings to achieve the best possible outcome of the project. The first 15 minutes of the daily meetings was used to set an agenda and goal of the day, and was completed by using the last 15 minutes to summarize the day. The product owner of the project is also the project's customer, and will only be referred to as the customer throughout this document. To maintain consistent communication with the customer, there were scheduled stand-up meetings weekly or if needed. These meetings allowed the group to continuously update the customer and demonstrate prototypes of the product. This ensured that the product developed corresponded to customer's vision. To aim for a product covering the end users needs, the customer provided a set of test users, to test the product iteratively during the development.

During the development process the group also utilised the principles of Extreme Programming, specifically the practice of pair programming. A decision based upon the groups desire to maximize the learning opportunities from each other resulting in the best possible outcome. 

\subsection{Development}
Throughout the development the group utilised the practice of issue tracking on GitHub (see chapter  \ref{GitHub}), and structured the tasks based on a roadmap using milestones. To ensure that the group followed the principles of scrum - it was decided to define the milestones as a correspondence to time, with each sprint as a milestone in the project.

To easily track the issues during the development the group used waffle.io (see chapter  \ref{Waffle.io}) as a scrum board. This provided the group a visualisation of the process - with issues in 'product backlog', 'sprint backlog' and 'in process' including who is working on which, using assignees. 

\subsection{Report}
Waffle.io was also used during the process of writing the report - primarily to ensure that every member participated in writing the report, and every member needed to proof-read each part before it were categorized as done.

\section{Team Organization}\label{projectOrganisation}
The group decided to divide the project into reasonable areas - and delegate the main responsibility to two or three of the group members, where one had the primary responsibility. This would ensure that all parts of the project were kept in mind during the development, as well as more than one person knew what was going on in one specific area.

\subsubsection{Scrum Master}
Responsible: Ingrid Skar \\
Skar was given the role as Scrum Master due to previous experience with leading a team and the coordination of scrum related tasks. This includes coordinating workpackages, sprints and milestones.

\subsubsection{Group Leader}
Responsible: Christina Hellenes Andresen \\
Andresen was voted to the role as group leader, this includes attending group leader meetings. The group also decided that the group leader was to create meeting agendas and lead the group meetings. 

\subsubsection{Contact Responsible}
Responsible: Sigve André Evensen Skaugvoll \\
The responsible person for keeping contact with both customer and supervisor was Skaugvoll. He was responsible of arranging meetings and sending them the meeting agenda before meetings.

\subsubsection{Architect}
Responsible: Martin Stigen \\
The role of architect was given to Stigen, due to interests and experience. The architect was responsible for providing initial draft to the architecture and for integrating the back end together with the front end. Skaugvoll was also a part of the architect team.

\subsubsection{Database}
Responsible: Andreas Norstein\\
Norstein was given the main responsibility for the database, this responsibility contains investigating the different options and needs. Norstein had this responsibility together with Skaugvoll.

\subsubsection{Back End}
Responsible: Sigve André Evensen Skaugvoll\\
The back end responsible was responsible for investigation the back end options. Norstein worked together with Skaugvoll after the group had decided on using Django to set up the development environment. Skaugvoll and Norstein were elected based on some prior experience through own projects, course at NTNU and interests.

\subsubsection{Front End}
Responsible: Thomas Wold\\
Wold was given the role of front end responsible, this were mainly because of experiences with front end development from courses he had attended at NTNU. This responsibility was shared with Skar and Stigen. Their work included choosing development language, framework and libraries, as well as preparing the development environment.

\subsubsection{Graphical User Interface Designer}
Responsible: Ingrid Skar\\
The graphical user interface designer was responsible for creating the paper prototype and styling the product. Skar was given the main responsibility to this task, together with Andresen, mainly because of interests in this field.

\subsubsection{Testing}
Responsible: Sigve André Evensen Skaugvoll\\
Skaugvoll was given the role as tester, this includes to set up test strategy and plan. Andresen and Skar were co-responsible for testing. 

\subsubsection{Report}
Responsible: Christina Hellenes Andresen\\
Andresen was given the role of report responsible, due to previous experience. This role includes setting up the table of content and keeping the report backlog on Waffle.io, \ref{Waffle.io}, updated. Wold was also a part of this team.


\section{Work Breakdown Structure}
The group decided to break down the project key activities into manageable sections, defined as work packages. By outlining the project and organizing it into smaller sections the group achieved a greater understanding of the scope of what was expected to be developed. The work breakdown structure outlined the project - providing the group further definition and description of the what was included in the work packages. 

\begin{figure}[h!]

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{fig/work_packages}
\caption{Work Breakdown Structure}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Gantt Diagram} 
The project's life cycle was visualised using a Gantt Diagram. This was useful while planning the development process, as the group achieved a common understanding of how long each phase of the project should be, and determine resources based on this. 

As the project was to be developed according to agile methodologies (see chapter \ref{methodology}) the model reflects this. The development is divided into iterations (sprints), lasting 2 weeks. The life cycle of the Other work packages depended on the scope; some lasted throughout the entire project, such as project management, and others occurred in specific phases, such as planning or testing.

\section{Risk Analysis} 
\label{riskAnalysis}
The initial risk analysis (see table \ref{risk_analysis}) was created during sprint iteration 0. The cases and their values were mainly based on previous experience from other projects. During the development of the project they were adapted to by thoroughly going through each case collaboratively, doing new evaluations. The new risk analysis can be found in the appendix XXX .

Each risk were evaluated and given a number between 1 and 9. Where one is minimal likelihood, but may occur and 9 is very likely to occur. The group then arrange the risks according to importance and sorted the risks in deciding order. The preventive actions are actions the group will preform to prevent the risk of happening. If a risk occurs the group should look at the remedial action to know what action to perform.

\section{Sprints}
\label{sprintsAndMilestones}
The group divided the development process into sprints, were each sprint lasted for two weeks running Monday to Friday the next week, and planned with respect to the given milestones (see section \ref{milestones}). During the sprints the group arranged daily stand-up meetings (\ref{daily-meetings}) and workdays (\ref{workdays}) to plan and work on the project.

\subsection{Workdays}
\label{workdays}
The group had four workdays a week, see table \ref{Time table}. The working hours were decided in the planning phase. During these hours it was expected that every member sat together and worked on the project. The hours were sat at times were no one had lectures or other activities to attend. To sit together and work made it easier to have an overview of what the rest of the group were working on and to get help from each other. During the workdays the group members worked on individual tasks.

\subsection{Daily Meetings}
\label{daily-meetings}
The daily meetings were used to update each other on what tasks each member was working on, any problems and agree on different decisions. Mondays was used to plan the upcoming sprint or review the progress of the ongoing sprint.

\caption{Weekly Time Table}
\label{Time table}
\end{longtable}


\subsection{Customer Meetings}
Initially, the customer and the group decided to meet bi-weekly, but realised this was too infrequent as the project developed. This was resolved by arranging weekly meetings. During these meetings the group updated the customer on the status of the product, and got feedback on what tasks to prioritize next. All meetings with the customer were documented (see an example in appendix XX).


\subsection{Supervisor Meetings}
The group met with the supervisor bi-weekly. During these meetings the supervisor was updated on the work completed and the plan for the next weeks. The supervisor also supported the group by answering questions regarding the report, work process and other relevant questions. All meetings were documented and the meeting minutes were sent to the supervisor's after the meeting (see an example in appendix XX).


\section{Milestones}
\label{milestones}
The milestones are the important dates given in the project and an internal deadline. In addition to this, the milestones consist of the project's phases - in accordance to GitHub's guidelines \cite{GitHubGuide}.

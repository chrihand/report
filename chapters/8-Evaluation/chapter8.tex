\chapter{Evaluation}

\section{Process}
\label{evaluationProcess}
This sections contains evaluation of the process, including both the methodology, development and challenges the group has met and resolved.

\subsection{Methodology}
\label{evaluationMethodology}
During the project the group utilized scrum (see \ref{methodology}) with sprints, daily stand-up meetings and retrospectives, this worked well and led to all group members being aware of what the others were working on. 

Sprints was conducted with 2 weeks duration, which was good for all but one sprints. Sprint 2 was the only sprint the group did not finish all planned features. Here the group had some problems concerning technology and under estimating of tasks (see section \ref{sprint2}). During the sprints the daily stand-up meetings helped the scrum master and other group members to be updated, and to prioritize the work remaining during each sprint. 

To visualize the progress of the project, and see who was working on what, as well as to keep track of the different milestones, the group used Waffle.io (see section \ref{Waffle.io}) which worked great for the group. The customer also had full access to the Waffle panel, were he could easily follow the project's progress, and add new milestones and issues to the project.

From Extreme Programming the group used pair programming. This was effective, because the pairs learned from each other as well as more than one member were aware of the status of the feature. Pair programming also gave the group validation when developing. Because there was always someone else that questioned the code, both logic and syntactical.

\subsection{Development}
The development was influenced on the process, methodology and the customer. The group developed in an iterative manner, and aimed to have new features to show the customer every week. Two times a week the group updated the live server with a new release. This way of developing worked very well, it made it possible for the group to focus on few set of features while working, and finalizing them before they started working on new features. Some features was more time consuming than others and some of the features demanded that the group had to acquire new knowledge. 

To keep track of the features that was to be developed, the group used GitHub and Git to maintain the code. Every features was developed on separated branches, and then merged with the main developing branch when a feature was done. This was done up to several times during each sprint. When a sprint was finished the master branch was updated, which updated the production server. The customer appreciated that the application was rapidly updated on the production server, because he could test it whenever he wanted and give the group feedback throughout the entire project period. This was helpful for the group as well, because it helped to prioritize which feature to implemented next, as well as fixing any bugs that occurred.


\subsection{Challenges}
The group has encountered a few challenges during the project.

As the group had decided to utilize new frameworks, libraries and working- and testing methods, some issues did occur. The entire group had some previous experience with Python, Javasript, HTML5 and CSS, but not very much experience with Django, React and Redux (see section \ref{frontEnd} and \ref{backEnd}). Since all of this was new, the group spent a lot of time learning how to use the tools productively. 

During sprint 2 the group had minor problems getting started with Flux (see section \ref{sprint2}). The group spent a lot time trying to set up a good working environment with Flux, but could not manage to do so. After research, the decision felt on using Redux instead. There was some problems getting this working as well, but after a short period of time, the application was running smoothly with Redux. 

Another challenge was to work together as much as planned. There was challenges with planning a group timetable so that meetings and workdays would not collide with other subjects. As well as planning when everyone could meet, it was a challenge to work this many people at the same project over the project's period. To work six people so close in a group over this long period of time, went surprisingly well. The group had minor discussions, which were all resolved in collaboration. Nothing that led to dissatisfaction within the group.

With the customer and users, the group faced a problem concerning how to present the facilitation for users. The customer was worried about hurting someones feelings by using symbols and words that described for whom an activity was facilitated for. After the second workshop (see section \ref{focusGroup}), the users actually just wanted standard symbols, that said if the activity was suited for them or not.    


\section{Cooperation With Customer}
From the very beginning the group started cooperating closely with the customer. Every week through out the entire project the group met with the customer (see section \ref{ss:customer_meetings} and example in appendix \ref{meeting_minutes_customer_meetings}). Throughout the entire project the customer was very engaged to the project. The customer and the group arranged workshops (see section \ref{WorkshopUserAndProviders}) and focus group (see section \ref{focusGroup}) with users and was attending them as well. The customer also arranged a focus group with possible providers and system maintainers for the application (see section \ref{focusGrouoProviders}). 
These focus groups and workshops helped the group in defining the requirements (see section \ref{functional_requirements}) and defining suggestions to milestones for further development (see section \ref{milestones_for_further_development}). The result were a proof of concept that actually proofs the need for this sort of web portal.

A challenge the group met with the customer was that he some weeks extended the scope of a requirement, and due to this gave the group more work for the upcoming week. These extensions were good ideas and therefore got the highest priority. The group also worked for satisfying the customers wishes, and the group believes that the customer were satisfied with the final product.


\section{Group Collaboration}
Since the start of the project, the group have been very motivated to work hard with this project and has striven to satisfy the customer as much as possible. All of the group members knows each other and have worked together in previous projects. The group collaborated very well through out this project as well and there has not been any big problems concerning communication within the group. If any misunderstandings appeared within the group either about the product, development or the process, everyone discussed the issue and quickly came up with a solution. In regards of the development, the group collaborated very well together. If any issues came up, non of the members hesitated to ask for help from others. In several cases the members of the group also took the advantage of pair-programming to learn from each other and to achieve the best possible result.

\section{Project Management}
\subsection{Risk Analysis}
\label{updated_risk_analysis}

During the project the group did not experience many disagreements or reasons for updating the risk analysis. Nevertheless, there were a few things that lead to some updates. The risks were "Group member being absent" and "Misunderstanding of task". The two risks is listed in table \ref{updated_risk_analysis_table}, containing the likelihood, impact, importance, preventive action and remedial action.

\subsection{Hours Worked}

The group worked well during the project time, the regular meetings helped to gain consisting progress and to keep track of what each member worked on (see table \ref{Hours_Worked} and fig. \ref{Hours_Worked_Burndown}). This lead to the group following the schedule and the group were able to have code freeze as planed the 7th of April, at the end of sprint 4, together with error correction in sprint 5. The hours were distributed (see fig. \ref{Distributed_Time}) between these different tasks; client meetings, coding, environment, design, testing, planning, meeting and report.

\section{Conclusion}
In the beginning of the project, it was arranged a workshop (see section \ref{WorkshopUserAndProviders}) with the users of the web portal. The workshop was used to gather as much information as possible, to actually understand what users wanted the portal to do and become. The group organized all of the information so that it was possible to make use of it. During the project, the group used the customer actively to get feedback on the functionality and the features represents the concepts he wants to prove. Together with the customer, group developed an application they thought would be suited for the users. 

In the end of sprint 4 (see section \ref{sprint4}) the group held a focus group (see section \ref{focusGrouoProviders}) with providers to see what they thought about the web portal. The providers was very happy with the result, and hoped that the development of the application would continue after the project was finished. In the beginning of sprint 5 (see section \ref{sprint5}) the group had a new focus group with the families (see section \ref{focusGroup}). This focus group turned out great. The families were very happy with the portal and wanted the group to continue working on it. 

The group are very satisfied with the project, and have appreciated working with both the customer and different users. Throughout the entire project, the group has tried to satisfy both users and the customer, which it seems they have achieved. As a final conclusion the group would like to express the satisfaction of delivering a concept they are proud of and a hope for the concept to be further developed to a final product with actual benefits.
